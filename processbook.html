<h1>Questions:</h1>

<h2>What do you want to achieve with the visualization?</h2>
<p>I would like to achieve with the visualization the understanding of the most common words in the
  fairy tales that call women. On all of these fairy tales every boy and girl grow up and I would
  like to check if the fairy tales are fixed in the way the women are described or do, they show
  strong and independent women and not the princesses waiting for the prince as we know from the
  classic fairy tales</p>


<h2>What tasks do you want to support?</h2>
<p>I would like the visualization to draw interest and discussion as to whether fairy tales
  that talk about women really represent a host of women and a host of traits and
  whether this can be changed in the future (or changed already).</p>
<p>I would like the visualization to be a believable mirror for stories and clearly see the common
  words without a doubt.</p>

<h2>What designs will help you accomplish these?</h2>
<p>Bar chart- we sew that people can be more accurate when the data is shown in a bar chart and here it's very important in this visualization</p>
<p>  Color factor- to pop up the most common words</p>
 <p> Tooltip hover- to make a minimal and easy to understand visualization a
  hover will be a great tool to add more information but not too much at first sight
</p>
